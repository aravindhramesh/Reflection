An iOS app made with SwiftUI to take quick notes and journal entries. The entries are grouped by day, searchable and stored in Core Data. 
The idea stemmed out of my need to have timestamps and datestamps every time I write something on my phone. I had to manually type it in Apple Notes which quickly got annoying. So I decided to use Claude AI and XCode to create my own iOS app
